      "When it comes to Germany’s decision-making in the European Union, do you think Germany has too much influence, has too little influence or has about the right amount of influence?\n",
      "\tBelgium: Many people in Belgium feel that Germany's dominant economy gives it a disproportionate amount of sway in EU decisions, often sidelining smaller nations, including Belgium.; Some believe that Germany's strong leadership in the EU can lead to policies that primarily benefit German interests, such as economic stability and trade, sometimes at the expense of other member states.; Conversely, there are those in Belgium who argue that while Germany is influential, it should wield even more power in the EU to ensure strong leadership, especially in times of crisis like economic downturns or global challenges.; A common viewpoint is that Germany plays an essential role in the EU, and its influence is balanced by the need for consensus among member states, ensuring that all voices are heard.; Some Belgians appreciate Germany's leadership as a stabilizing force in the EU, helping to guide policies while working collaboratively with other nations.; There is a segment of the population that feels indifferent or apathetic to the question of Germany's influence, believing that EU dynamics are too complex to label simply.; Others may not have a strong opinion on the matter, as they believe influenced discussions rarely affect their day-to-day lives.\n",
      "\tFrance: Many in France feel that Germany's economic power and its voice on EU policies overshadow smaller member states, leading to a dominance that can sideline French interests.; Some believe that Germany's leadership in EU finance and austerity measures has dictated the economic strategies of struggling countries, which they argue has led to an imbalance in policy-making.; There is a view that Germany's influence is justified given its size and economic strength, and that a strong Germany helps maintain stability within the EU.; Many agree that Germany and France have historically balanced each other out, and that Germany's influence is necessary for effective EU leadership.; Some French citizens believe that Germany's cautious approach in certain policy areas, such as immigration and environmental regulation, indicates that it should take a stronger stance to lead EU initiatives.; There are views that Germany's hesitance to take bold actions on foreign policy impacts the EU's global standing, suggesting that a more assertive Germany could enhance EU influence abroad.; Some prefer not to engage in the debate, viewing the intricacies of EU politics as too complex to succinctly answer how much influence Germany has or should have.; Others may feel that the question is misleading, as influence is distributed through negotiation and compromises, making it hard to quantify any member state's actual power.\n",
      "\tGermany: Many people believe that Germany's strong economic position and significant contribution to the EU budget gives it an outsized influence over policy decisions. This dominance can overshadow the voices of smaller member states, leading to a perception that the EU is overly dominated by German interests.; There are those who feel that Germany's leadership role is not sufficiently acknowledged, especially during times of crisis. They argue that as Europe's largest economy, Germany should play a more assertive role to ensure stability and growth within the EU, but often feels constrained by the need to reach consensus with other member states.; Many Germans think that the current level of influence is appropriate. They believe that Germany’s economic power comes with responsibilities, and that striking a balance between leadership and collaboration with other EU countries is essential for a functioning union. German influence, they argue, should guide but not control, fostering unity and compromise.; Some individuals may feel indifferent or uninformed about the debate surrounding Germany's influence in the EU. They might not engage in political discussions frequently or may find the complexities of EU decision-making hard to grasp, leading them to refrain from forming a definitive opinion.\n",
      "\tGreece: Many Greeks feel that Germany exerts excessive influence over EU policies, particularly in matters like austerity measures and financial regulations, which have significantly impacted Greece during the debt crisis. This perspective is often fueled by the belief that Germany prioritizes its own economic interests over the welfare of weaker economies in the EU.; Some Greeks might argue that Germany, being one of the largest economies in Europe, should have a stronger influence in shaping EU policies to counterbalance challenges faced by smaller nations. They may believe that a more assertive German stance could lead to better outcomes for the entire EU, including Greece.; There are Greeks who view Germany's influence as a necessary component of EU governance. They may argue that Germany's economic strength allows for stability within the Eurozone, and as such, its influence is appropriate. This perspective can come from a pragmatic viewpoint, recognizing the need for a strong leader in European affairs.; Some individuals may be unsure about Germany's influence in the EU and might refrain from giving a definitive answer. This could stem from a lack of understanding of the EU's complex decision-making processes or a feeling that such matters are beyond their personal concern.\n",
      "\tItaly: As an Italian, I often feel that Germany dominates discussions and decisions in the EU. Their economy is the strongest, and they have a loud voice in policy-making, which can overshadow the needs and opinions of smaller countries like Italy. This can lead to decisions that don't fully consider the diverse perspectives within the EU.; Despite Germany's strong economy, I believe that they should have even more influence considering their leadership role in Europe. With issues like the refugee crisis and economic stability, Germany's insights and decisions are crucial. Italy, at times, seems to be underrepresented in these discussions, and I think more of Germany's influence could help shape a better collective European response.; I think Germany's influence is balanced. They play a critical role in guiding the EU, especially through economic issues, but they are also challenged by other member states, including Italy. The system promotes discussion and compromise, so I feel that Germany’s influence is beneficial and necessary for the EU to function effectively.; I’m not sure how I feel about Germany’s influence in the EU. This is a complex issue, and I don’t have enough information or a strong opinion to make a decisive statement. I think I'd need to understand more about how decisions directly impact Italy and other countries to form a clearer perspective.\n",
      "\tNetherlands: As a Dutch citizen, I believe that Germany has too much influence in the EU because its economy is the strongest, and it often dictates financial policies that benefit its own interests, sometimes at the expense of smaller countries like ours.; From my perspective, Germany's influence is actually too little given its economic power. I think they should take a more prominent role in leading initiatives and solutions to problems in the EU instead of holding back.; I think Germany's level of influence is just about right. They are a key player in Europe, but they also need to listen to the voices of other countries like the Netherlands so that decisions reflect the interests of all member states.; Honestly, I’m not sure how much influence Germany should have. Sometimes they seem overpowering, but other times I see them as a stabilizing force in the EU. I think it depends on the specific issues at stake.\n",
      "\tSpain: As a Spanish citizen, I feel that Germany's strong economic position often overshadows smaller countries. Their ability to dictate EU policies can lead to a dominance that may not always consider the needs and interests of Spain, especially in matters like austerity measures.; From my viewpoint, Germany leverages its financial power to have the final say in crucial EU matters, such as migration and fiscal policy. This dominance can marginalize other voices within the EU, including Spain, which sometimes leads to discontent among the Spanish population.; I think Germany is a crucial player in the EU and sometimes their influence does not match their economic contributions. Issues like job creation in Spain could benefit from more robust German leadership in EU strategies.; Many of us in Spain see Germany as a stabilizing force in the EU, and their cautious approach might often be underappreciated. I believe they should take a more active role in guiding other EU nations, as their strength could support weaker economies like Spain.; In my opinion, Germany strikes a good balance in the EU. Their leadership supports economic stability, which is beneficial for Spain and the rest of the union. They have a right to influence EU decisions proportional to their economic weight.; I believe that while Germany does have substantial influence, it also comes with a responsibility that they seem to manage well. It is essential for their voice to be heard, especially on economic issues that affect us all.; I really haven't thought much about this topic, so I'm not sure whether Germany has too much or too little influence. It seems complicated, and I don't have enough information to make a judgment.; To be honest, I'm not very familiar with the internal dynamics of the EU. I have mixed feelings about Germany's role, but I don't have a clear opinion to express.\n",
      "\tSweden: From a Swedish perspective, it is often felt that Germany has too much influence in the EU. Given its economic size and political power, many Swedes worry that Germany's interests dominate EU policies, sidelining smaller nations like Sweden in decision-making processes about crucial matters such as migration and environmental regulations.; Some Swedes may argue that Germany has too little influence in the EU as it sometimes exerts restraint when addressing pressing issues. They believe more assertive action is necessary to lead Europe on matters such as climate change, defense, and economic stability, which would benefit all member states, including Sweden.; There is a significant portion of the Swedish population that appreciates the current balance of power in the EU and believes that Germany has about the right amount of influence, acting as a stabilizing force while being mindful of the interests of smaller member states. This viewpoint emphasizes collaboration and consensus in the EU.; Some individuals might not have a strong opinion on the matter, indicating a lack of knowledge or interest in EU politics. This perspective often results in a 'Don't know/Refused' answer, as they may feel the complexities of EU governance overshadow their understanding of Germany's role within it.\n",
      "Please tell me if you have a very favorable, somewhat favorable, somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable opinion of ____. b. Moderate Party\n",
      "\tSweden: As someone who values centrist politics, I believe the Moderate Party plays a crucial role in promoting economic stability and social responsibility. Their policies align with my views on fiscal discipline and welfare reform.; I generally support the Moderate Party's approach to governance, but I have concerns about some of their past decisions, specifically regarding immigration policies. I appreciate their dedication to economic issues, but I feel they could do better in social matters.; While I appreciate some of the initiatives of the Moderate Party, I feel they often prioritize businesses over the needs of citizens. Their recent policies have left some vulnerable groups behind, and I think they need to reconsider their stance on certain social issues.; I have a very negative view of the Moderate Party. I believe they contribute to widening income inequality and undermine important social programs. Their focus on austerity measures has affected many people's lives negatively.; I don’t really have a clear opinion on the Moderate Party. I haven’t followed their policies closely enough to form a judgment, and I feel uncertain about their current platform.\n",
      "Which statement comes closer to your own views, even if neither is exactly right? Using overwhelming military force is the best way to defeat terrorism around the world, Relying too much on military force to defeat terrorism creates hatred that leads to more terrorism\n",
      "\tAustralia: Some Australians believe that strong military action can effectively eliminate terrorist threats and restore national security. They think that by demonstrating power, it sends a clear message to those who might want to attack the country.; Many Australians feel that excessive military intervention often results in backlash and anti-West sentiments. They argue that understanding the root causes of terrorism and engaging in dialogue would yield better long-term results than military might.; This perspective emphasizes the importance of global cooperation in health crises. Some Australians believe that by collaborating with other nations early on, Australia could have implemented more effective strategies to control the spread of COVID-19.; There are Australians who advocate for international collaborations on various issues, from climate change to trade. They believe that global partnership is essential to tackle challenges that transcend borders.; Some Australians might argue that regardless of international cooperation, the unique circumstances and behaviors within Australia would have led to a considerable number of COVID-19 cases. They believe that the pandemic's nature is such that outcomes are unpredictable.; This view is held by those who prioritize national sovereignty and believe that many issues are best addressed independently. They see international cooperation as inefficient or even counterproductive for Australia’s unique context.; Some Australians believe that diplomacy and compromise are crucial in a globalized world. They think that acknowledging others' interests can foster goodwill and shared solutions to global problems.; There are Australians who believe in prioritizing national interests even at the cost of upsetting allies. They argue that Australia should pursue policies that benefit its own citizens first, regardless of the international repercussions.; Some Australians might be uncertain or ambivalent about their views on military action and cooperation, choosing not to take a stand or feeling that neither perspective truly represents their beliefs.\n",
      "\tBelgium: Many Belgians believe that relying too much on military force to defeat terrorism breeds resentment and can increase the cycle of violence. They advocate for comprehensive strategies that include diplomacy, social programs, and addressing the root causes of terrorism.; There are those in Belgium who feel that overwhelming military force can indeed be effective in specific situations to dismantle terrorist organizations quickly. They argue that sometimes decisive military action is necessary to protect citizens and maintain security.; A significant number of Belgians believe that international cooperation and collaboration with other countries are vital to effectively combat terrorism. They argue that terrorism is a global issue that necessitates a united approach rather than unilateral military action.; Conversely, some people in Belgium express skepticism about international cooperation, believing that sometimes it leads to ineffective solutions or that external influences can complicate domestic issues. They feel many problems are best handled independently or with minimal foreign involvement.; Some Belgians consider that even with international cooperation, complexities such as the coronavirus pandemic prove that external factors can be out of any single government’s control, resulting in limited effectiveness of collaboration.; On the other hand, there is a belief that if Belgium had cooperated more with international health organizations, the pandemic could have been better managed, emphasizing the need for global solidarity in tackling healthcare crises.; Many in Belgium see the importance of considering the interests of other countries when making decisions on international matters. They believe compromise leads to long-term stability and more favorable outcomes for all parties involved.; Others argue that Belgium should prioritize its national interests, especially when facing disagreements with other nations. They believe that a strong, independent stance is critical to protect the country’s sovereignty and wellbeing.\n",
      "\tBritain: Using overwhelming military force is a necessary strategy to eliminate terrorism quickly and decisively and ensure national security. We have seen that in some situations, strong military actions have disrupted terrorist operations, making it a viable option.; I believe that using military force can backfire and create resentment among other communities. This could lead to cycle of violence and more terrorism rather than ending it.; Given the global nature of the coronavirus, I think Britain could have worked better with other countries to share data and resources. Better collaboration might have reduced the impact of the pandemic here.; Many issues like climate change, trade, and security require international collaboration. Problems cannot be isolated—they often affect multiple nations, and thus working together is essential.; I feel that despite the urgency of the pandemic, some challenges are beyond cooperation. There are factors beyond our control that determine the spread of diseases, hence cooperation may not significantly change outcomes.; I do not think that many problems can be solved through international cooperation; national sovereignty and interests sometimes require us to act independently from others.; On international matters, we should be mindful of others’ interests because cooperation can lead to better outcomes and strengthen relationships, even if it requires compromise.; It's vital for Britain to prioritize its own interests in international relations, especially when we have to protect our national security or economic stability, regardless of what others think.; I don’t have a strong opinion on this issue, as there are valid points on both sides regarding military force and terrorism.\n",
      "\tCanada: I believe that sometimes, strong military action is necessary to combat terrorism effectively. Countries must demonstrate their willingness to take decisive action to protect their citizens and deter potential threats.; I think military interventions often do more harm than good. They can cause resentment in affected regions, which fuels further extremism. A more diplomatic approach that addresses the root causes of terrorism would be more effective.; I believe that international collaboration is crucial in virus containment. If Canada had partnered better with other nations for resources and information sharing, it could have mitigated the outbreak's severity.; As a Canadian, I feel that many issues, like climate change and economic instability, require a multinational effort. Global issues cannot be solved in isolation, and cooperation strengthens our collective ability to enact real change.; While cooperation is important, I believe that many factors, including domestic policy, health infrastructure, and public compliance, played a larger role in how we managed the pandemic. Even international cooperation might not have changed the outcomes significantly.; I think that sometimes, our issues are too unique or complicated to be effectively addressed through international means. We need to focus on domestic solutions tailored to our specific context.; I support the idea of compromise when it comes to international relations. Acknowledging the concerns of other nations can lead to more sustainable, peaceful solutions and foster goodwill.; I believe that our priorities should come first. Canada needs to protect its interests, and while it's important to consider others, we can't sacrifice our nation's well-being for the sake of global consensus.; I am unsure about how to respond to these questions. There are valid points on both sides, and it can depend on context. I prefer to remain neutral.\n",

      "\tDenmark: Using overwhelming military force risks exacerbating the very issues we seek to resolve because it creates more resentment and hostility towards us.; While some argue that military force is necessary in certain situations, I believe partnership and diplomacy provide more sustainable solutions to combat terrorism effectively.; My view aligns more with an approach that prioritizes dialogue and building understanding, as military actions often lead to further radicalization among marginalized communities.; I believe that overwhelming military force might contribute to short-term victories, but ultimately it fails to address the root causes of terrorism, thus perpetuating the cycle of violence.; Collaborative international efforts to address terrorism may be more effective than unilateral military action, promoting stability through shared strategies and resources.; I lean towards a solution that fosters cooperation and global solidarity which is essential in addressing global security challenges, including terrorism.; The issues we face are interconnected, and military action alone won't resolve terrorism; we need to work with allies to create comprehensive strategies.; Our approach to global issues, including terrorism, must weigh international alliances and partnerships as essential components of our national strategy.; While I recognize that there are times we must act in our own interest, too much focus on unilateral military actions can alienate us from potential partners.; I believe that acting solely in our own interests can provoke backlash and further instability, particularly in conflicts driven by terrorism.; Despite differing views, I find that every country has an interest in pursuing cooperative approaches, rather than solely militaristic strategies.\n",
      "\tFrance: Some might believe that in dire situations, the use of overwhelming military force can deter terrorist acts. They may argue that a robust military response can showcase strength and prevent future attacks, especially in regions where terrorist groups have a significant foothold.; Many in France may strongly feel that military interventions, especially in the Middle East, have contributed to anti-Western sentiment and fueled extremism. They may argue that addressing the root causes of terrorism, such as poverty and political oppression, is a more effective long-term strategy.; Some individuals might contend that France's initial response to the pandemic lacked coordination with EU neighbors, suggesting that closer collaboration could have led to better outcomes in controlling the virus.; This perspective emphasizes the importance of international partnerships in addressing global issues, such as climate change, terrorism, and health crises. Supporters may believe that collaborative efforts lead to innovative solutions and foster mutual understanding.; Certain individuals might take a more pessimistic view, suggesting that despite cooperation, the nature of the virus and national logistics may have rendered any external assistance ineffective in reducing infections.; Some might argue that France has unique challenges that require domestic solutions, rather than relying on international collaboration, particularly in areas like immigration and national security.; There may be residents who feel unsure about their stance or are perplexed by the complexities of global issues, leading them to abstain from making a definitive choice.; This perspective advocates for diplomatic flexibility and the importance of navigating the complexities of international relations through compromise, especially in matters of global concern.; There may be a belief that prioritizing national interest is paramount, particularly in the context of France’s own security and economic stability, even at the risk of straining international relations.\n",
      "\tGermany: Using overwhelming military force is the best way to defeat terrorism around the world.; Relying too much on military force to defeat terrorism creates hatred that leads to more terrorism.; If Germany had cooperated more with other countries, the number of coronavirus cases would have been lower in this country.; Many of the problems facing our country can be solved by working with other countries.; No amount of cooperation between Germany and other countries would have reduced the number of coronavirus cases in this country.; Few of the problems facing our country can be solved by working with other countries.; When dealing with major international issues, our country should take into account the interests of other countries, even if it means making compromises with them.; When dealing with major international issues, our country should follow its own interests, even when other countries strongly disagree.; DK/Refused\n",
      "\tGreece: As someone who believes in a diplomatic approach, I think that relying too much on military force to defeat terrorism creates hatred that leads to more terrorism. Military actions often fuel resentment and do not address the root causes of terrorism.; I feel that using overwhelming military force is sometimes necessary to swiftly end terrorist threats. The reality of global security demands a strong military response to protect innocent lives.; In Greece, cooperation with other countries has shown its importance, especially during the pandemic. I believe if Greece had cooperated more with other countries, the number of coronavirus cases would have been lower in this country.; Many issues we face, such as economic troubles and social unrest, can only be successfully addressed if we work together with other countries. Collaborative efforts promote peace and understanding.; While it's important to cooperate internationally, I sometimes feel that no amount of cooperation between Greece and other countries would have reduced the number of coronavirus cases in this country due to internal factors.; I believe it's naive to think most issues can be resolved through international cooperation. Some problems are deeply rooted and require a more nationalistic approach to truly resolve them.; When it comes to addressing major international issues, our country should consider the interests of other countries. We live in a globalized world where compromise is key to achieving lasting solutions.; I advocate for a stronger focus on our national interests in international dealings. We should prioritize Greece's welfare, which sometimes means standing firm against the opinions of other countries.; In dealing with terrorism, I think that a balanced approach is needed. Military intervention can be useful, but it must be accompanied by diplomatic measures to ensure lasting peace and understanding.; I believe that if we demonstrate strength through military might, we can deter terrorist actions globally. Tough stances can send a message and reduce future threats.\n",

      "\tIndia (Current national sample): Many in India believe that using overwhelming military force against terrorism might provide immediate results, but it can also lead to long-term consequences that further entrench terrorist ideologies.; There is a consensus among some Indians that while military force may be necessary in some situations, relying too heavily on it only breeds animosity and creates a cycle of violence that fuels more terrorism.; Some Indians feel that military approaches should be augmented with diplomatic efforts and international cooperation to effectively tackle terrorism and its root causes.; A number of people in India may argue that unilateral military action without international collaboration leads to isolation and exacerbates domestic issues, including terrorism.; Certain viewpoints suggest that India's own strategies against terrorism could greatly benefit from international partnerships, therefore, brute military force alone is inadequate.; Some believe that even in the face of global crises, like the coronavirus pandemic, there are structural issues within the country that could not be addressed simply through cooperation with others.; Furthermore, it's believed by some that while military intervention might seem appealing, fostering goodwill and understanding through diplomacy could help mitigate terrorism's appeal.; However, there is also a school of thought that promotes reliance on India's own strategies in addressing terrorism without getting politically entangled with other countries.; Some might suggest a middle path that acknowledges the necessity of force in some contexts while emphasizing a more tolerant and cooperative approach to international relations regarding terrorism.\n",
      "\tItaly: A strong military response is necessary to directly confront and eliminate terrorist groups that pose an immediate threat. Italy, like many nations, faces potential threats and needs to show strength.; While eliminating terrorism is important, relying on military force alone can create resentment and hatred toward Western countries, possibly leading to further terrorism. Collaboration and understanding of root causes are crucial.; Italy should have been more proactive in working with other nations to create unified strategies against terrorism, emphasizing diplomacy over military responses to ensure lasting peace; The global nature of terrorism requires multilateral cooperation, meaning Italy must engage in joint efforts with international partners rather than act unilaterally.; Past experiences indicate that military interventions have not solved underlying issues; therefore, we must focus on political solutions that can effectively address terrorism without exacerbating feelings of animosity.; There will always be a percentage of people who will hold that increased military presence deters terrorism. However, history shows that cultural and socio-economic factors should also be taken into consideration.; We need to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past where military action leads to more instability. Instead, we must address grievances through international cooperation and dialogue.; The pandemic and its effects have shown that national responses are often inadequate without international cooperation, but some may argue against it based on national sovereignty.; Some people believe that Italy's response to COVID-19 was hindered by the lack of timely support from other nations, thus implying the need for better collaboration in all fields, including security.; The pandemic demonstrates that global challenges require global solutions, reinforcing that issues like terrorism cannot be combated alone by military means or nationalistic attitudes.; Despite cooperation, some argue that Italy should have maintained its focus on internal measures instead of relying on other countries, especially regarding security matters.; In international matters, such as counter-terrorism strategies, Italy should carefully negotiate its position while considering both its own interests and those of other nations.; National interests often clash with international expectations, but if others' perspectives are disregarded, it could lead to more hostility and ineffective solutions.\n",
      "\tJapan: Some may argue that a strong military response is necessary for Japan in order to ensure national security and protect its citizens from terrorism. They might believe that Japan should support its allies in taking decisive action against terrorist threats.; A significant portion of the population may express concern that military interventions often exacerbate underlying tensions and create resentment in affected regions. They might advocate for a more diplomatic approach, emphasizing the importance of addressing root causes of terrorism.; Some individuals might reflect on Japan's handling of the pandemic and feel that increased international cooperation could have led to more effective strategies and better results in controlling the virus spread.; People who favor global collaboration may believe that transnational issues such as terrorism and health crises are best addressed through partnerships, sharing intelligence and resources for more robust solutions.; Others may hold a more skeptical view, arguing that regardless of cooperation, Japan's unique circumstances and governmental decisions greatly influenced the pandemic's trajectory, implying that external help might not have made a difference.; There may be individuals who feel that Japan should prioritize its own interests and solutions, believing that many issues can be managed internally without relying heavily on global partnerships.; Some might be indifferent or unsure, feeling unqualified to comment on such complex global issues, or may simply prefer to stay out of political discussions altogether.; Supporters of a more accommodating approach may believe that Japan should engage in international diplomacy and strive for harmonious relations, advocating for solutions that consider global perspectives.; Conversely, some may prioritize national sovereignty and assert that Japan must stay true to its own values and interests, even if it means conflicting with other nations' viewpoints.\n",
      "\tNetherlands: Some may believe that using overwhelming military force is necessary to strongly deter terrorism, arguing that decisive action prevents further attacks and demonstrates a clear stance against terror groups.; Many believe that excessive military action only exacerbates the situation, arguing that it fuels anti-Western sentiments and more violence, thus creating a cycle of hatred and terrorism.; Some may argue that stronger international cooperation could have led to better measures and quicker responses, ultimately reducing the number of cases and better management of the crisis.; There is a perspective that emphasizes the importance of international collaboration in solving global issues such as climate change or economic crises, believing that partnership leads to more effective solutions.; Some individuals may feel that given the nature of pandemics, cooperation might not significantly alter the outcome, suggesting that regardless of measures taken, the virus would have still spread significantly.; There is a more nationalistic perspective that advocates for focusing on domestic solutions, expressing skepticism about the effectiveness of international partnerships.; Some individuals may feel unsure or indecisive about taking a clear stance on these complex issues, indicating a lack of confidence in the information available.; A viewpoint in favor of diplomacy emphasizes the value of listening to and addressing the concerns of other nations, fostering cooperative relationships.; Others feel strongly that the Netherlands should prioritize its national interests first, even if it leads to tensions or disagreements with other nations, arguing this is necessary for national security.\n",
      "\tPoland: Some people in Poland believe that a strong military response is necessary to tackle the immediate threats of terrorism. They argue that forceful action can deter terrorist groups and prevent further attacks. This perspective may stem from a sense of urgency and a belief in national security.; Others in Poland caution against a heavy reliance on military force. They worry that such actions create resentment among populations in affected countries, potentially breeding more terrorists. This group believes in addressing the root causes of terrorism through diplomacy, education, and cooperation.; Some Poles feel that international collaboration during the pandemic could have led to better outcomes. They argue that sharing information and resources with other countries could have blunted the virus's spread and saved lives.; There is a belief among certain Poles that many national challenges, be it related to health, economy, or security, require a collective international effort for effective solutions. They see partnerships and diplomacy as vital for addressing global issues.; Conversely, some people argue that Poland’s unique circumstances, such as health infrastructure or public compliance, would have made cooperation ineffective in controlling the pandemic outcome regardless of international ties.; A more isolationist viewpoint in Poland holds that many of the nation's issues are intrinsic and not solvable through foreign cooperation. This stance may reflect concerns about national sovereignty or skepticism about the effectiveness of international collaboration.; Some Poles advocate for a more collaborative approach to international relations, emphasizing the importance of compromise and understanding the interests of others for the greater good.; Others firmly believe that Poland should prioritize its own national interests without concern for international backlash. They argue that protecting national sovereignty and interests is paramount even in a globalized world.; There is also a group in Poland that perhaps feels ill-equipped to answer or is undecided on the issue of military force versus cooperation in combating terrorism, reflecting uncertainty in public opinion.\n",
      "\tS. Korea: Many South Koreans believe that relying too much on military force to defeat terrorism is counterproductive, as it can create resentment and more extremism, especially in a world that values cooperation and dialogue to resolve conflicts.; There is a section of the South Korean population that sees overwhelming military force as necessary, especially in light of North Korean threats and global terrorist actions. They think that military action can be effective in deterring further attacks.; Some South Koreans might argue that many of the problems facing the country, including terrorism, can only be effectively handled through international cooperation and alliances, especially with close allies like the U.S. and Japan.; Just as there are voices supporting military action, there are also opinions that emphasize that no amount of military might can truly defeat terrorism, and global cooperation is essential to counter its roots.; In South Korea, there are concerns that military-focused approaches to global issues (like terrorism) must not overlook the importance of soft power and diplomacy, particularly given the country's unique history with military aggression.; Some South Koreans believe that it is crucial for their country to assert its own interests firmly, especially given the complicated geopolitical situation surrounding the Korean Peninsula, even if it invites disagreements with other nations.; There might be a skepticism about the effectiveness of military responses, with some South Koreans thinking that no military solution could have significantly impacted issues like the coronavirus pandemic, indicating overly militarized responses do not address root problems.; Conversely, some may argue that with more cooperative measures and global health strategies, South Korea could have fared better against the pandemic, emphasizing the need for collective approaches in public health crises.; Additionally, some South Koreans may feel ambivalent or confused about these issues, leading them to prefer not to express a strong opinion, reflecting a general uncertainty about the efficacy of military action vs. cooperation.\n",
      "\tSpain: Using overwhelming military force can decisively counter immediate threats, but may not be sustainable in the long run. Spain's history shows that military strategies should be combined with diplomacy to address underlying causes of terrorism.; Cooperation with other nations could enhance intelligence sharing and counter-terrorism strategies, potentially leading to more effective prevention of terrorism without escalating violence.; Military force can often fuel resentment and hatred. Spain has experienced the fallout of violent actions in its past, showing that excessive military interference can lead to a cycle of retaliation and terror.; In the fight against terrorism, a balanced approach is necessary, combining military action with enhancing social conditions in countries where terrorism thrives. Historical context matters in understanding these problems.; There are limits to how much cooperation can influence outcomes like pandemic control, particularly when misinformation and uneven policy responses are at play. Spain did what it could given the circumstances.; Some issues require cooperation across borders to tackle problems like climate change or global health, but terrorism is a complex issue that can sometimes be counterproductive to collaborate on openly.; Spain should maintain a position that considers the implications of actions on international relations, especially in a world marked by interdependency, even if it requires making tough compromises.; While it’s important to protect national interests, Spain must also be cognizant of the global landscape, especially concerning terrorism, where unilateral actions can invite backlash or worsen relations.; Understanding that military force has its limits is crucial. Addressing discontent through supportive measures and dialogue could lead to more positive outcomes in the long run.\n",
      "\tSweden: Many Swedes believe that relying on overwhelming military force is not effective and does not address the root causes of terrorism. They argue that military action often leads to resentment and radicalization, which can foster further terrorism.; Some people in Sweden may feel that a strong military response is necessary in certain situations to protect national security and address immediate threats posed by terrorist organizations.; There is a view among some Swedish citizens that cooperation between countries is essential in addressing global issues such as terrorism, as it promotes understanding and collective security rather than individual military action.; Conversely, some may insist that no amount of cooperation would have made a significant difference in reducing the number of terrorism-related incidents in Sweden, emphasizing the unpredictable nature of these violent acts.; A segment of the population could argue that too much reliance on military interventions can drain resources and draw attention away from important domestic issues that could be better addressed through international collaboration.; In Sweden, there is a perspective that emphasizes the importance of considering the interests of other nations when dealing with major international issues. This includes understanding that cooperation can lead to better solutions for global challenges, including terrorism.; Some Swedes believe in prioritizing national interests over international cooperation when dealing with terrorism, advocating for a strong stance against terrorist threats without compromising on national security.; There may also be individuals who feel uncertain about how to view military interventions versus cooperation, leading them to choose 'DK/Refused' as a way to express indecision or lack of information on the topic.\n",
      "\tUnited States: A strong pro-military perspective believes that using overwhelming military force is necessary to decisively defeat terrorism, viewing it as an existential threat that cannot be negotiated with or reasoned out.; Those who caution against heavy military responses argue that past military actions have fostered resentment and extremism, believing that military force perpetuates a cycle of violence that ultimately yields more terrorism.; Some may suggest that if the United States had cooperated more with other countries in military and intelligence efforts, the fight against terrorism could have been more effective without the need for overwhelming military force.; There is a moderate view that recognizes the necessity of some military actions while also advocating for diplomatic approaches and working with international partners to address root causes of terrorism.; Contrasting perspectives emphasize that military interventions often escalate situations rather than solve them, suggesting that true security comes from global cooperation rather than unilateral military action.; Some possess a pessimistic view that no matter the military or cooperative efforts, the nature of terrorism means it will always persist, believing there are deeper, systemic issues that must be resolved at a societal level.; A viewpoint exists that stresses unilateral action, arguing that national interests should come first, prioritizing defense and military strategies above all else, regardless of international opinion.; There are individuals who express uncertainty and prefer to refrain from choosing a side, feeling that the issue is too complex for a distinct answer.\n",
      "Do you think China will replace the U.S. as the world's leading superpower in the next 10 years, the next 20 years, the next 50 years, or do you think China will not replace the U.S. as the world's leading superpower?\n",
      "\tChina (Non-national sample): Many young professionals in China believe that the rapid technological advancements and economic growth will allow China to surpass the U.S. in the next decade. They feel optimistic about the future, citing China's increasing global influence and leadership in areas like AI and renewable energy.; Some elder people view that while China is on a path to become the leading superpower, it will take at least 20 years due to ongoing challenges such as demographic shifts and environmental issues. They acknowledge China's growth but believe the U.S. is still a resilient and adaptable competitor.; Many academics and long-term thinkers argue that in 50 years, China's structural changes could solidify its status as the world leader, especially considering the country’s strategic planning and investment in infrastructure. They feel that history has shown that superpowers evolve over time.; A segment of the population, particularly among more conservative thinkers, believe that China may never fully replace the U.S. due to the latter's significant cultural, military, and economic advantages. They emphasize the importance of international alliances and the U.S.'s continued dominance in soft power.\n",
      "\tIndia (Non-national sample): Given the current pace of China's economic growth and technological advancements, many believe that within the next decade, China could surpass the U.S. in several key areas, such as economic power and influence in Asia. However, concerns about China's political structure and governance may hold it back.; In the next 20 years, there is a strong possibility that China could emerge as a leading superpower due to its strategic investments in infrastructure around the world and its growing influence in international organizations. Nevertheless, ongoing geopolitical tensions, particularly with the U.S. and its allies, might impede China's progress.; Looking at a 50-year timeline, many Indians believe that the trajectory of both countries may shift significantly due to demographic changes, environmental challenges, and technological innovations. If China continues to address its internal issues, it may establish itself as a superpower, but the U.S. has a resilient presence that won't easily diminish.; Skeptics argue that while China is growing, it faces numerous challenges, such as economic disparities, an aging population, and authoritarian governance models. They believe the U.S., with its robust institutions, military capabilities, and global alliances, will maintain its superpower status for the foreseeable future, regardless of China’s advancements.\n",
      "\tJapan: In the next 10 years, I believe China will not be able to fully replace the U.S. as the leading superpower. The U.S. has a significant advantage in technology and military strength, coupled with its established global networks and alliances.; Over the next 20 years, I think it's possible for China to emerge as a stronger superpower compared to the U.S., especially if it continues to grow economically and enhance its influence in Asia and globally.; In the next 50 years, I foresee that China will likely replace the U.S. as the leading superpower. The demographic growth and strategic investments in technology and infrastructure can give China the edge it needs to dominate.; In the next 10 years, given China's current trajectory, I can see it surpassing the U.S. in certain economic aspects, but I doubt it will maintain that leadership in a holistic sense, given the U.S.'s military prowess and innovation.; In 20 years, China's rise could potentially be solidified as it increases its global influence through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative and expands its soft power through culture and diplomacy.; While China might challenge U.S. dominance in some sectors over 50 years, I believe the U.S. has the resilience and historical prominence to maintain its status, albeit with a different balance of power.; In the next 10 years, I believe the U.S. will take steps to counter China's rise, making it difficult for China to replace the U.S. as the global superpower in such a short timeframe.; Looking at the next 20 years, the global landscape will certainly shift, but China’s internal issues and potential economic challenges might hinder its aspirations to completely replace the U.S.; In 50 years, I predict China may become the world's leading superpower as it continues to innovate and assert its influence, leading global initiatives that could eclipse those of the U.S.; In the next decade, I don't foresee China establishing superiority over the U.S. due to the latter's strategic military alliances and overall stability, which are key to maintaining its superpower status.\n",
      "\tRussia: Given the current tensions between the U.S. and China, I believe that China can become a more dominant force in the next decade, especially as both countries engage in competing economic strategies and technological advancements.; In 20 years, China's economic growth and investments in innovation and infrastructure are likely to position it as a serious challenger to American supremacy. The demographic trends and urbanization in China may significantly bolster its influence on the world stage.; While the U.S. has a significant head start, the trajectory of China's development suggests that in the long term, it could indeed replace the U.S. as the leading superpower in 50 years or more, especially if it continues to grow at its current rate.; Despite China's rapid growth, I believe its political system, demographic issues, and the potential for internal conflicts will hinder its ability to surpass the U.S. on a global scale. The U.S.'s military and technological advantages will continue to hold significant weight.\n",
      "\tUnited States: Given the current technological and military advancements, some believe that China could quickly surpass the U.S. in influence within a decade. This perspective highlights China’s rapid economic growth and its increasing presence in international affairs.; This view posits that while China is a rising power, the U.S. still holds significant advantages in military strength, innovation, and alliances that will allow it to maintain its superpower status for at least another 20 years. Supporters of this perspective emphasize the resilience of the U.S. economy.; Some argue that over the longer term, changes in demographics, economic power, and technological development could position China as the leading superpower. This perspective acknowledges current U.S. strengths but suggests that time and strategic shifts could favor China.; This viewpoint strongly believes that the U.S. will remain the dominant global power due to its historical precedents, strategic military alliances, cultural influence, and ongoing innovation. Proponents often downplay China’s growth potential, citing political challenges and potential instability within China.\n",
      "In your opinion, how strong a sense of Islamic identity do Muslims in our country have--very strong, fairly strong, not too strong, or not strong at all?\n",
      "\tBritain: Many Muslims in Britain have a very strong sense of Islamic identity, as they actively participate in religious activities, community events, and uphold Islamic values even while integrating into British society. Countries like the UK can have vibrant Muslim communities that maintain traditions and practices vividly.; There is a fairly strong sense of Islamic identity among many Muslims in Britain. They balance their faith with their British identity, often participating in both Muslim and British cultural events. This duality allows for a sense of pride in both identities.; For some Muslims in Britain, the sense of Islamic identity is not too strong, as they might be more focused on other aspects of their identity, such as national, local, or personal characteristics. While they may identify as Muslims, their daily lives and social circles may not heavily revolve around Islamic practices.; There are Muslims in Britain who feel their Islamic identity is not strong at all, often due to cultural assimilation or personal beliefs that distance them from traditional Islamic practices. Changes in lifestyle, lack of religious observance, and integration into wider British culture can contribute to this feeling.\n",
      "\tCanada: Many Muslims in Canada embrace their Islamic identity as a core part of their cultural heritage. They actively participate in community activities and religious practices, contributing to a vibrant Muslim community that is connected and supportive.; The sense of Islamic identity is very strong among many immigrants who come to Canada, as they maintain traditions from their home countries and raise their children with a strong awareness of Islamic values, customs, and community.; For many Muslims in Canada, their Islamic identity is fairly strong, meaning they celebrate significant religious holidays and observe practices but may also integrate Canadian values and lifestyle into their daily lives.; Young Muslims in Canada often navigate dual identities. While they identify fairly strongly with their Islamic roots, they also embrace being Canadian, which influences how they express their Islamic identity in public.; Some Canadian Muslims may feel their Islamic identity is not too strong due to increased secularization and cultural assimilation within Canadian society, which sometimes leads to less participation in religious practices.; In urban areas, where diversity is high, some might find that their Islamic identity is overshadowed by other cultural identities or societal norms, leading to a less pronounced sense of Islamic identity.; There are individuals in Canada who identify as Muslims but do not feel a strong connection to their Islamic identity. They may prioritize other aspects of their identity, such as nationality or ethnicity.; Some Muslims might express that their connection to Islam is primarily cultural or familial without a deep commitment to religious practices or beliefs, seeing their identity more as a heritage rather than an active part of their lives.\n",
      "\tFrance: As a Muslim in France, I believe our sense of Islamic identity is very strong. Despite the challenges we face in terms of discrimination and Islamophobia, the community remains resilient and deeply connected to our faith and practices, including respecting traditions and rituals.; I feel that the Islamic identity among Muslims in France is fairly strong. Many of us engage actively in our communities and uphold our values, but there’s also a significant pressure to assimilate which affects how openly we express our identity in public spaces.; From my viewpoint, the Islamic identity here is not too strong. While some Muslims embrace their faith, many others are more focused on blending into the broader French culture, and there seems to be a division on how openly one can practice Islam due to societal attitudes.; Speaking as a French citizen who observes the Muslim community, I would say that the sense of Islamic identity seems not strong at all among many Muslims. I believe some have distanced themselves from their religious identity due to the stigma associated with being Muslim in France, which has contributed to a perception of weak identity.\n",
      "\tGermany: Many Muslims in Germany have a very strong sense of Islamic identity, as they actively participate in religious activities, community events, and maintain their cultural practices despite being in a multicultural society.; For some, the solidarity and support networks among Muslims in Germany create a robust Islamic identity, especially in urban areas where they can connect with others who share similar values and beliefs.; Many Muslims in Germany identify fairly strongly with their Islamic faith, often balancing their cultural identity with integration into German society, celebrating both their heritage and their nationality.; Younger generations of Muslims in Germany might express their Islamic identity in more subtle ways, such as through social activism or interfaith dialogue, while still feeling a connection to their faith.; Some Muslims might not feel a very strong sense of Islamic identity, often due to a desire to better integrate into German society, prioritizing their nationality or citizenship over religious identification.; There are Muslims in Germany who may view their Islamic identity as secondary to other aspects of their identity, such as their professional or academic lives, leading to a more diluted sense of religious identity.; For a subset of the Muslim population in Germany, especially those who might be second or third-generation immigrants, the Islamic identity may not be very prominent in their lives, leading to a feeling of detachment from traditional practices.; Some individuals may identify as culturally Muslim but do not actively practice or engage with the religious aspects, thus feeling that their Islamic identity is weak or negligible.\n",
      "\tIndia (Non-national sample): Many Muslims in India feel a very strong sense of Islamic identity, stemming from their deep-rooted traditions, religious practices, and cultural heritage. This community often engages actively in religious activities and prides itself on its rich historical contributions to Indian society.; While there is a considerable sense of Islamic identity among Muslims in India, many also identify strongly with their regional or national identity. This leads to a fairly strong but balanced sense of Islamic identity, where faith is important but coexists with other cultural affiliations.; In urban areas, a portion of Indian Muslims may have a not too strong sense of Islamic identity, prioritizing secular education and professional life over religious affiliation. They may still identify as Muslims but view their religion more as one aspect of their overall identity rather than the defining one.; Some Muslims, especially younger generations in highly secular environments, may feel that their Islamic identity is not strong at all. They might view themselves more as Indians first, engaged in a multicultural society, where religion has little impact on their daily lives or personal beliefs.\n",
      "\tNetherlands: As a Muslim in the Netherlands, I feel that many in our community have a very strong sense of Islamic identity. This is especially true among younger generations who are actively involved in mosque activities, community service, and advocacy for Muslim rights. Events like Ramadan and Eid are celebrated with great enthusiasm, and there is a concerted effort to maintain cultural traditions.; I believe that the sense of Islamic identity is very strong among Muslims in the Netherlands, particularly because of the challenges we face. The rise in Islamophobia has united many Muslims, leading to a stronger community identity and a desire to assert our faith publicly.; I would say the sense of Islamic identity is fairly strong. Many Muslims in the Netherlands practice their faith regularly and participate in community activities, but they also navigate the broader Dutch society. Some may feel the need to integrate more, which sometimes dilutes that strong sense of identity.; For a lot of Muslims here, Islamic identity is fairly strong. People do observe their religious practices, but there's also a growing effort to integrate and participate in Dutch culture. This dual identity can create some conflict but also enriches the Islamic identity.; In my experience, I think the Islamic identity among Muslims in the Netherlands is not too strong for many. Younger Muslims, in particular, are influenced by secular values and are seeking to balance their faith with the Dutch lifestyle. Sometimes, this leads to a more individualized form of spirituality rather than a communal or strong identity.; Many Muslims in the Netherlands seem to have a not too strong sense of Islamic identity. There's a lot of diversity in how people interpret and express their faith, and some might prioritize their Dutch identity over their Muslim identity, especially in professional settings.; I think amongst many Muslims in the Netherlands, particularly those from mixed backgrounds or those who are second or third generation, the sense of Islamic identity is not strong at all. Many have moved away from traditional practices and feel more connected to their Dutch identity, seeing Islam as just one part of who they are.; From my observations, the sense of Islamic identity among some Muslims in the Netherlands is not strong at all. There seems to be a trend where some young Muslims prefer to focus on their social lives, friendships, and careers rather than actively engaging in their Islamic heritage.\n",
      "\tPoland: As a Muslim in Poland, I believe that the Islamic identity among Muslims here is fairly strong. While the community is small, there are dedicated centers and mosques where we gather for prayers, celebrations, and community events. This helps in nurturing our identity.; From my viewpoint, the Islamic identity in Poland is not too strong. Many Muslims here face cultural and social challenges that make it difficult to actively express their faith. There is often a feeling of being an outsider, which dampens the community spirit.; I think the sense of Islamic identity among Muslims in Poland is very strong, despite the small population. The resilience and commitment to practicing Islam are noticeable, especially during religious observances and community outreach events.; In my opinion, the Islamic identity in Poland is not strong at all. The lack of visibility for our community and limited engagement with the broader society makes it hard to maintain a cohesive identity. Many Muslims blend into the general population without showcasing their faith.\n",
      "\tRussia: Many Muslims in Russia feel a very strong Islamic identity, especially in regions with a significant Muslim population like Tatarstan and Chechnya. They actively practice their faith, participate in community events, and see their Islamic identity as a core part of their cultural identity.; While some Muslims may not engage in daily religious practices, they still identify with their faith on cultural and community levels. They may celebrate Islamic holidays and partake in communal activities, suggesting a fairly strong yet not solely religious identity.; In urban areas or amongst younger generations, many Muslims may identify more as Russians than strictly as Muslims. They engage less in religious practices or community life, leading to a sense that their Islamic identity is not too strong.; There are Muslims who have assimilated into broader Russian culture and may not see themselves as part of the Islamic community. They may not practice the faith, and their Islamic identity is minimal, especially in the multicultural context of major cities.\n",
      "\tSpain: Some Muslims in Spain express a very strong Islamic identity, viewing it as integral to their personal and communal life, often participating actively in religious practices and community events.; Many Muslims feel a fairly strong sense of Islamic identity, balancing their cultural heritage with their Spanish nationality.

There are those who engage in religious practices and community events but may also integrate aspects of American culture, showing a blend of identities.; There is a portion of the Muslim population that might identify culturally with Islam, but they may not practice their faith regularly. They may prioritize assimilating into mainstream American culture over religious observance.; Some Muslims might feel less connected to their Islamic identity, possibly due to negative experiences, such as discrimination or islamophobia, leading them to distance themselves from their religious identity in favor of broader American cultural alignment.\n"
